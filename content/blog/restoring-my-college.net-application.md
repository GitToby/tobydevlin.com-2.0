# My First Code Experience

During college, I took a computing module. It was taught by an enthusiastic man who, because of this course, has influenced my career decision to move into software and taught me to know just enough to solve the problems at hand and argue every last detail until proven wrong; so thanks, Joe. In retrospect, I probably should have made more effort with this project but the name of the game was to just pass, looking back at it now this thing was full of security flaws and was built under a flawed development model. It was great!

This code was initially developed on a rubbish laptop that sometimes turned off unexpectedly, with the entirety of development isolated from any type of version control or any type of backup. However, to submit the code to the exam folk the entire piece of work: design proposal, waterfall dev cycles, code, 143 pages of manual test evidence, had to be printed, bound and shipped off - all for that vital number telling me how clever I was (am).

This post will be dedicated to the story of how I brought it back from the **paper** I was forced to print it out on and into the 21st century - open-source crap dumped on Github.

## The First Steps

The code is on paper so I need to have the entire (  ) page collection of code transcribed into actual text. From there I can look into building the class structure and finally running the app.

### Pictures! 

I'll spare you the details but painstakingly I have photographed every page of code that's required. This includes all the SQL files where, for some foreshadowed reason, I picked '_chicken'_ for all my passwords. Security at its finest.
